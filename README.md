# funnyTools
This repository is created when I am reading the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python". I learnt a lot of funny technique from this book and I can't help to implement some interesting ideas.

In the repository, I will create several folders. Each folder represents an interesting and useful tool that can help you boost the efficiency.

## 1. multi-clipboard

Imaging you have several accounts for the different websites. Let say you have an account for github.com, and you have another account for taobao.com, I wish your password for these websites are different, because the different password can save you from the risk of a security breach if one of the websites gets hacked. 

But the different password usually will drive people crazy, because it's too hard for people to remember all of them. 

So here comes the multi-clipboard. You can use the simple command below to easily *save* your password the the computer and *get* the password whenever you need. And you don't need to worry about the risk of the password breach because what we used here is the  **shelve** module. It save your password to the disk with the binary format, so the only way to get the password is running the special command below.

```
